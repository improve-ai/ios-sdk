 Track a passive observation of a variant.  This method does not provide necessary counterfactual information on non-chosen variants, so it is STRONGLY recommended to instead use -trackUsingBestFromDecision: whenever possible.  Passive observations are only intended to supplement training data in cases where it is difficult to track full Decisions.  Training a model based solely on passive observations is likely to lead to biased models.
